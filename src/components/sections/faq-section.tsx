  {
    question: "2️⃣ How can automation help my business?",

  },
  {
    question: "8️⃣ Do AI Agents replace my employees?",
    answer: "AI Agents don’t replace your whole team — but they can take over repetitive, time-consuming tasks, so you don’t need to hire extra staff for busywork. This means lower costs, fewer errors, and faster response times, all while keeping your business lean and efficient."
  },
  {
    question: "9️⃣ Is my data safe?",
    answer: "Yes. We use secure integrations and industry best practices to keep your data protected. Your privacy and confidentiality are a top priority."
